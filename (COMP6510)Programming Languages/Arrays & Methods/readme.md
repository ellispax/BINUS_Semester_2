Problems:

1. Take an array of length n where all the numbers are nonnegative and unique. Find the
  element in the array possessing the highest value. Split the element into two parts
  where first part contains the next highest value in the array and second part hold the
  required additive entity to get the highest value. Print the array where the highest value
  gets split into those two parts.
  
  Sample input: 4 8 6 3 2
  
  Sample output: 4 6 2 6 3 2
  
2. Write a program to shift every element of an array to circularly right. E.g.-
Ask the user how many times (ROT) will it shift the contents of the array

INPUT : 1 2 3 4 5

ROT: 1

OUTPUT : 5 1 2 3 4

3. Initialize a Multidimensional array of size 3x3.
E.g.-
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Check if the matrix is symmetric or not.
*Few important points to remember: A Square Matrix is said to be symmetric if it is equal to
it's transpose. Transpose of a matrix is achieved by exchanging indices of rows and columns.
Transpose is only defined for a square matrix.
